# VenvRecipes for Aivia

**Important note: The current VenvRecipes are only compatible with Aivia 10.0.1 or above. Please upgrade to Aivia 10.0.1 or above to run VenvRecipes.**

VenvRecipes are ready-to-use except they will be executed under the required virtual environment automatically.

Each of these recipes will create the required virtual environment for itself at the first time of execution.
