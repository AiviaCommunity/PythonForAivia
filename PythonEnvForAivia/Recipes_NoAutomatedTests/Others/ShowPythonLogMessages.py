"""
Prints any new Python-related messages printed to the Aivia log to the Python console.

The log_dir variable points to the default Aivia log path for the latest stable
release by default. If it does not work for you, you need to set the log_dir variable
to the path shown in File > Options... > Logging > Folder.

Run this file either in Idle or in a CMD window using:
> python ShowPythonLogMessages.py

Stop logging by pressing CTRL+C in the console.

Note that this only updates the console as often as Aivia is set to flush to the log.
This can be changed in File > Options... > Logging.

Requirements
